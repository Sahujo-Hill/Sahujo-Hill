  I'm currently employed as an Associate Software Engineer at Howden Insurance Services developing, refactoring and maintaining interactive insurance software.
  I've been there since 2022 and have spent time facing users, configuring the software and will now be applying what I've learnt into a development role.<br></br> 
  I've studied and continue to study HTML, CSS, C# and design/web design concepts. I've built a lot of my own styling but have also used Bootstrap and OpenIconic where applicable.<br></br>
  I've worked primarily in Blazor, writing front-end and back-end for over a year for personal projects and coursework. I've recently begun writing bUnit and nUnit tests as well as hosting sites via Azure and Hostinger.<br></br>
  My current interests cater towards creativity and applying what I've learnt from user interaction into my work, to design pieces that have human factors in mind.
