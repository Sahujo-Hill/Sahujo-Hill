  I'm currently employed as an Application Technician at Howden Insurance Services working to improve their insurance documentation, I am due to start as an Associate Web Developer in late September.
  I've been there since 2022 and have spent time facing Users, configuring the software and will now be applying what I've learnt into a development role./<br></br> 
  I've been studying and continue to study HTML, CSS and C# for over a year and have studied design/web design concepts.<br></br>
  I've worked primarily in Blazor, writing coagulated C# and Markup for over a year for personal projects and coursework. I've recently begun writing bUnit tests and enjoyed hosting sites via Azure (when it works!).<br></br>
  My current interests cater towards creativity and applying what I've learnt from user interaction into my work, to design pieces that have human factors in mind.
