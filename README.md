## 💫 About Me:
- 🥅 **Working** in .NET building insurance software.

<p align="left">
  I'm currently employed as an Associate Software Engineer at Howden Insurance Services developing and maintaining interactive insurance software.
  I've worked primarily in Blazor, writing front-end and back-end for over a year for work, personal projects and coursework. My team and I practice test-driven and trunk-based development.
  I've hosted sites via Azure, Hostinger and fly.io.
  My current interests cater towards creativity and applying what I've learnt from user interaction into my work, to design pieces that have human factors in mind.

## Current Projects
**🟥 Never Sated**

I'm building a small indie video game using the Unity engine where everything will be designed and built by me, including characters, levels, music, animation, story etc.
Unity makes use of C# and .NET practices so I'm not straying away from my roots, whilst building my knowledge of the video game development process.
Everything I'm doing/have done can be tracked by <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Management-1e5519cf45638074bc97fa8f3ea8a379?pvs=4">this board</a>.
I'm also collating images of the artwork and parts of the game <a href="https://www.notion.so/Concept-Art-1eb519cf456380eaac84e3a25e9fe97c?pvs=4">here</a> but note that this page won't contain finalised designs to help prevent plagiarism. 
This project is looking to take upwards of 2 years to complete based on my current trajectory and I don't plan to rush it, it's a passion project at the end of the day.

  🦇 Warhammer quenches my thirst for armageddon. I primarily paint Chaos (apologies, fans of the emperor) and am currently painting some Night Lords, inspired by <a href="https://infinitespeculation.wordpress.com/2020/12/10/book-review-night-lords-the-omnibus-by-aaron-dembski-bowden/">The Night Lords Omnibus</a> by the wonderful Aaron Dembski-Bowden. Check out my reddit for some shots of my work.

   🚗 I'm a sucker for cars, and am fortunate enough to drive a beautiful 2020 Kona blue Mustang (responsibly) around the country lanes of England. I'm currently working on a mobile-first <a href="https://fordmustang.fly.dev/">portfolio for the car</a>, this is accessible via QR code at car shows to bring some .NET to these .OLD-fashioned showings
